# Tablevation
INSE Coursework

To run the site offline follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to your machine - https://github.com/LucindaAshdown/Tablevation.git

2. Once cloned or downloaded open the folder ‘Website’

(In there you will find all our static/dynamic pages that will be used and updated through our database when live/running.)

3. Double click or right-click then select a browser of your choice to load index.html to take you to the home page.

4. As this is only an offline site you are restricted to what you can access e.g - if you try to login in you will just be sent back to the home page and same goes for creating an account you will just be redirected to the login page as it isn’t a live site.

5. For editing the tool Atom.io was used and the lines of code are comments to describe what does what (HTML, CSS and js), I have also used javascript files such as: bootstrap, query and validate for the forms. (These files can be found in Tablevation/Website/js directory)

6. If you wish to see the other pages you would simply need to follow step 3 but with the page you wish to visit. What you will notice is some pages are blank as these pages are dynamic and will be filled once the server and database is running.
